# Welcome to Graphcool!
#
# This is where we will store and document the graphql schema.  Graphql
# is an open standard and this schema can be hosted by a number of 
# different graphql providers, including ourselves if we choose to do 
# so.  For the first few iterations, we'll use graphcool as a gql 
# provider.  In the future we may elect to host gql ourselves for 
# better connectivity with our markets and possibly for better control
# of our data if this is deemed necessary.
